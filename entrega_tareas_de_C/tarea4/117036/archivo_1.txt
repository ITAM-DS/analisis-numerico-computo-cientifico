The merry old king of Katoren has died
and there’s no heir to the throne. Six sour ministers rule the land
and claim that they’re looking for a new king,
but nothing happens – for seventeen years.
Then suddenly there’s a boy standing at the door of the royal
palace who was born on the night the king died.

This boy, Stach, has firmly resolved to become the new king of Katoren and
he asks the six ministers what he must do in order to be considered for
the role. The ministers, afraid of losing their splendid position at court, give the
boy seven almost impossible tasks, which can be brought to a successful
conclusion only by one who possesses kingly attributes such as wisdom,
courage and self-sacrifice. The six ministers are convinced that Stach will fall
at the first hurdle, but he turns out to have an amazing amount of
persistence and ingenuity.
